            <ol>
                <li>artificial intelligence is the technology that will have the greatest impact on my lifetime.</li>
                <li>the threat of misalignment and misuse of capable artificial intelligence models is significant. the potential for takeoff and lack of interpretability only make this harder to forecast and work to mitigate.</li>
                <li>current methods towards increasing safety including alignment and governance seem fuitle in the face of rapid open-source iteration and progress.</li>
